## Risk Register

### High Risk Items
1. **AWS Service Limits**: Verify Lambda concurrency limits in target region
2. **Object Lock Configuration**: Cannot be disabled once enabled - ensure correct settings
3. **KMS Key Management**: Key deletion has 7-day waiting period
4. **Cost Management**: Monitor actual vs projected costs closely in first month

### Medium Risk Items  
1. **Performance Under Load**: Real-world performance may differ from projections
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Some sites may block headless browsers
3. **Compliance Validation**: May require external audit for full certification

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting configured
- Gradual rollout with staging environment validation
- Regular cost reviews and optimization
- Professional services engagement for compliance audit
