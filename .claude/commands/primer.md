# Command: primer
Prime on the repo + CSA docs.

## Steps
1) If docs/manifest.yaml exists, read it and load all entries with `normative: true`.
2) Otherwise, read these in order:
   - docs/CSA-Spec.md
   - docs/CSA-Design.md
3) Summarize MoSCoW MUSTs, NFRs, security (Object Lock + SSE-KMS), data models, and endpoints into PLANNING.md.
4) Extract open tasks into TASK.md with acceptance criteria that reference REQ IDs (if present).
5) Confirm the repoâ€™s code and tests align with the spec; list any deltas.
