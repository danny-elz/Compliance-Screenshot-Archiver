```

### Terraform Variables (terraform.tfvars)
```hcl
# Environment
environment = "production"
region      = "us-east-1"

# Naming
project_prefix = "csa"
resource_prefix = "compliance-screenshot-archiver"

# Security

```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Terraform Deployment Issues
```bash
# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Validate Terraform configuration
terraform validate

# Plan with detailed logging
TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform plan

# Apply with auto-approval for CI/CD
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### Lambda Container Issues
```bash
# Test container locally
docker run -p 9000:8080 csa-capture-lambda:latest

# Check ECR login
aws ecr describe-repositories --region $AWS_REGION

# Force Lambda update
aws lambda update-function-code \
  --function-name csa-capture-lambda \
  --image-uri $ECR_URI/csa-capture-lambda:latest
```

### API Gateway Issues
```bash
# Test API Gateway directly
aws apigateway test-invoke-method \
  --rest-api-id $API_ID \
  --resource-id $RESOURCE_ID \
  --http-method GET

# Check CloudWatch logs
aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix "/aws/apigateway"
```
